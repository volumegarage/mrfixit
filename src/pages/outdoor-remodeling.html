              we can design and construct your absolute dream indoor or outdoor
              fire feature to keep you cozy during our chilly winter nights.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Arbor Construction - </span> No home remodel is complete
              without a perfect landscape to surround you with lush greenery and
              amenities. This includes landscape design, landscape lighting,
              patio and driveway construction, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Hot Tub Covers and Platforms - </span> –Sometimes taking a dip in the
              ocean isn’t in the cards, and you need an outdoor pool to satisfy
              your aquatic craving. We’ll create one that perfectly suits your
              needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Roofing - </span> – Why would you live in the Miami area
              and not have an outdoor kitchen? The weather is perfect for nights
              out grilling for friends or hosting a party.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Room Additions - </span> – If you have a basement, don’t let the
              space go to waste. We can transform it with the addition of a wet
              bar, entertainment center, even a movie theater!
