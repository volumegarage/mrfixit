        <h1>Add-Ons to Your Home Remodel Project</h1>
        <p>
          <span>Basement Remodeling - </span>
          As a full-service design/build firm, we have additional options to
          absolutely transform your living space. A few of these include:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Room or home Additions - </span> During your home remodel, we
          can design and construct your absolute dream indoor or outdoor fire
          feature to keep you cozy during our chilly winter nights.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Garage Construction - </span> No home remodel is complete
          without a perfect landscape to surround you with lush greenery and
          amenities. This includes landscape design, landscape lighting, patio
          and driveway construction, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Outdoor Kitchens - </span> –Sometimes taking a dip in the ocean
          isn’t in the cards, and you need an outdoor pool to satisfy your
          aquatic craving. We’ll create one that perfectly suits your needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Flooring - </span> – Why would you live in the Miami area and
          not have an outdoor kitchen? The weather is perfect for nights out
          grilling for friends or hosting a party.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Drywall - </span> – If you have a basement, don’t let the space
          go to waste. We can transform it with the addition of a wet bar,
          entertainment center, even a movie theater!
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Fireplace Replacements - </span> – if your family is growing or
          you just need more space, we can build out your home until it’s the
          size you need.
